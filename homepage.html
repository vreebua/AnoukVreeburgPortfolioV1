                    <h3>HI, I'M ANOUK</h3>
                    <p>I am 21 years old and I live in Almere, although almost moving to Amsterdam. I’m currently studying Communication & Multimedia Design at the HvA in Amsterdam. I really like creating stuff from anything from designs, websites, music and more, especially stuff that is fun and catch attention. In my free I love painting, dancing, rock climbing and listening to music.</p>

                    <h3>UNITY</h3>
                    <p>I discovered and worked in Unity only this year, but I think I am quite a fast learner. Unity brings all my skills together and challenges me in the most fun way. I get the opportunity to combine my art and music and program it all together with C#, what i really like.</p>

                    <h3>ILLUSTRATOR</h3>
                    <p>I have been working with Adobe Programs since the beginning of my college, so for about three years. One of my favourites is Illustrator, I have used this software in many cases, from creating covers, icons, UI elements and more. I like how creative I can get in the application, it really has a tool for everything.</p>

                    <h3>PHOTOSHOP</h3>
                    <p>Another close to my heart software is Photoshop. I really love that Photoshop helps me create and adjust any image I want into something completely different and yet sometimes also believable, I find it a really fun tool.</p>

                    <h3>PREMIERE PRO</h3>
                    <p>Premiere Pro is also a fun software for me to play with. In group projects I always try to take the lead in the video editing, because I find it very calming to do. You can make a simple video in any theme that you want with the right editing, which I have experimented a lot with.</p>

                    <h3>AFTER EFFECTS</h3>
                    <p>Another favourite of mine is After Effect, I got into this software recently and I am learning skills to create different animated shorts and scenes. I really love the results that this software brings.

                    <h3>CODING</h3>
                    <p>Just as Adobe, I started working with code in the beginning of my college, starting out with HTML and CSS. In the beginning of my second year I got more into programming when I discovered the powers of JavaScript. After my interest grew, I have not stopped coding and learning ever since.</p>
